The reason as to why I have used a deref. c to check for q is so that when I press enter, it'll take note of it. If I did not do that, it would quit immediately! As it would have updated.
Can set terminal attributes using tcgetattr() to read current attributes into a struct!
With this, modifing the struct by hand and passing modified struct to tcsetattr to write new terminal attributes
ECHO in the instance of enableRAWMode is a bitflag, we just used the bitwise operator NOT (~)
Made a disable raw mode, where we use a global variable origTermios to retain the original state before exit. raw will equal origTermios before anything is modified.
Using ICANON, we read byte by byte, allowing us to quit by pressing q instead of entering it.
